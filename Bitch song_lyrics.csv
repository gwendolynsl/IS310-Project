Control Yourself,Hugga Rockz,"2 ContributorsControl Yourself LyricsI think its time 2 set the record str8
Tell Flex i said OBAMA this bitch
Kendrick Lamar ain't part of this shit
Just remember mutha fucka that u started this shit
Coulda figured u was smarter then this

U must started 2 sniff
Little nigga this home of the legends
Emergency call from 9/11
U ain't kicking over our towers devour any city u reppin
Ya u about 2 meet the secret weapon

Couldn't let him get away wit disrespecting Melly Mel and Rahiem
Freddie the God and all in-between
Pick ur best 5 bet i get some animals 2 swallow ur team
We been the nightmare in all of ur dreams

All ur LIFE
Drag u in the dark make u see the light
Just by the length of ur arms know u don't wanna fight
In the future better think about the shit that u write
Ill have u mission like vanilla ice

Stick a fork in the king of New York thas from the West
And up and comin artist thinking that they next
That don't wanna recognize biggie as the best of all times
And thas com in str8 off the strength
You might also likeHeard Tyler ain't never been 2 YO
Seem like the popular trend is anything is a go
Lil Wayne is insane ya i could fuck wit the flow
But wat the fuck is he saying if he ain't saving the poor
From following in the same path

I ask cause its whack and I'm mad that the math don't add
Kanye West situation is sad
Wat do u gain from the world
If u ain't safe from the wrath

Turn this shit 2 a blood bath
U niggas keep fuckin around
Everybody got they eyes on the crown
But if u ain't getting down from here on out then just bow out
Can't swim i say let em drown

2 many parana and not enough sharks in the tank
2 many wanna be MCs and bars i could think
Just of the top of my head
I said if hip hop dead then I'm hop in and resurrect

East Coast Nigga
Dres ok but Eastwoods better
Snoop got heat but ain't touching JayZ cheater
Truth
TIP gon keep the South 2gether
But he ain't fuckin with that New York weather
You gotta be born wit tough skin 2 make it thru a year or 2
Radio ain't even playing wat we really do
If they let this shit rock it be a miracle
Ready 4 watever u got cause i ain't scared of u

Lemme make it clear 2 u stop u perpetrating a fraud
U ain't 2pac u ain't that hard
If u ask me I'mma say ur voice sound odd
Like u been working at a blow job

4 a long time
Said a mind is a terrible thing 2 waist
Guess he thought he was secure in his place
U ain't running shit nigga this ain't even a race
U better stay over there where its safe

Catch a case if u say that bullshit on the east
Illuminati got y'all niggas confused must be the mark of the beast
Close ur mouth better watch wat u speak
Talk is cheap if u really wanna walk wit elites stop talkinEmbed"
